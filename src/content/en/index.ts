    subtitle: 'In the Last Page Bulletin of Parliament, January 12, 2025',
    desc: `UN Secretary-General António Guterres recommended that the Israeli occupation cancel all closure measures of the crossings leading to the Gaza Strip and respect international humanitarian law regarding Palestinian civilians. Guterres added, during the presentation of an annual report to members of the United Nations General Assembly on "Israeli practices affecting the human rights of the Palestinian people in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem," that the occupation must "take all necessary measures to ensure full respect for international humanitarian law in relation to Palestinian civilians living under occupation." He called for "the immediate cessation of all practices that may amount to torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, and for guarantees against the repetition of these practices," demanding that Israel "immediately lift measures closing the crossings to the Gaza Strip, and ensure that all Palestinians enjoy the right to freedom of movement in the occupied Palestinian territory." Guterres stressed "the necessity for Israel to fulfill its responsibilities as an occupying power to ensure that Palestinians have access to appropriate health care, respect the rights of Palestinian children, and guarantee that journalists, human rights defenders, and civil society actors can carry out their activities without harassment."`,
